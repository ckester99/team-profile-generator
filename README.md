# Team Profile Generator

## Purpose
This is an application I made using node.js to allow a manager to create an html file that displays information about their current team. The application uses the CLI to ask for the information about the manager and then gives the users options to add an engineer, add an intern, or finish building the team. Once the user is finished with the team, the application generates an HTML file displaying the team info and writes it to the dist directory. I also used jest to add tests for each of my classes to keep the code maintainable.
